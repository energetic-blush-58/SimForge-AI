⚡ SimForge AI: Autonomous Agent Simulation Lab
Powered by AIDP.store Decentralized GPU Network

SimForge AI is a high-performance environment where autonomous AI agents evolve through physics-heavy simulations. By leveraging AIDP's decentralized RTX 4090/3090 compute, we run complex neural networks and real-time rendering that traditional centralized clouds cannot handle efficiently.

🧠 System Architecture
SimForge utilizes a multi-tier compute pipeline designed for maximum GPU saturation:

Plaintext

[ AIDP GPU NODE (RTX 4090) ]
       |
       +--- [ Layer 1: Inference Engine (Ollama/Llama-3) ]
       |      - Drives agent reasoning and decision-making logic.
       |
       +--- [ Layer 2: Physics Engine (Headless 3D) ]
       |      - Real-time interaction modeling and collision benchmarks.
       |
       +--- [ Layer 3: Data Orchestrator (Docker/Python) ]
              - Bridges LLM outputs to simulation state changes.
🚀 Why AIDP?
High-Performance VRAM: Utilizing 24GB+ VRAM on AIDP nodes for local Llama-3-8B inference.

Cost Efficiency: Up to 80% cheaper than AWS/GCP, enabling long-running evolutionary cycles.

DePIN Scalability: Instant access to global GPU clusters for multi-agent parallel training.

📊 Performance Benchmarking (Targeted)
SimForge is optimized to push AIDP hardware to its limits:
