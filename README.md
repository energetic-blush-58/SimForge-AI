# ⚡ SimForge AI: Autonomous Agent Simulation Lab
**Powered by AIDP.store Decentralized GPU Network**

SimForge AI is a high-performance environment where AI agents evolve through physics-heavy simulations. By leveraging AIDP's decentralized RTX 4090 compute, we run complex neural networks and real-time rendering that traditional clouds can't handle efficiently.

## 🚀 Why AIDP?
- **High Performance:** Utilizing RTX 4090/3090 VRAM for local LLM inference.
- **Low Cost:** 80% cheaper than centralized providers.
- **Scalable:** On-demand compute for multi-agent training.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **AI Engine:** Llama-3-8B (Ollama)
- **Framework:** Python / Docker
- **Hardware:** AIDP Decentralized GPU (SOL Chain)

## 📦 Quick Start
