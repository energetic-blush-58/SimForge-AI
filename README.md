⚡ SimForge AI: Autonomous Agent Simulation Lab
Powered by AIDP.store Decentralized GPU Network

SimForge AI is a high-performance environment where autonomous AI agents evolve through physics-heavy simulations. By leveraging AIDP's decentralized RTX 4090/3090 compute, we run complex neural networks and real-time rendering that traditional centralized clouds cannot handle efficiently.

🚀 Why AIDP?
High-Performance VRAM: Utilizing 24GB+ VRAM on AIDP nodes for local Llama-3-8B inference.

Cost Efficiency: Up to 80% cheaper than AWS/GCP, enabling long-running evolutionary cycles.

DePIN Scalability: Instant access to global GPU clusters for multi-agent parallel training.

🧠 Technical Architecture
SimForge utilizes a hybrid compute pipeline designed for maximum GPU utilization:

Inference Layer: Runs quantized LLMs via Ollama to drive agent decision-making.

Physics Engine: A headless simulation environment calculating agent interactions in real-time.

Verification: Logic-based checkpoints ready for ZK-proof generation to ensure simulation integrity.

🛠 Tech Stack
AI Engine: Llama-3-8B (Ollama / PyTorch)

Containerization: Docker for one-click deployment

Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (via AIDP Network)

Chain: Solana (SOL)

📦 Quick Start (Deployment on AIDP)
Once your AIDP GPU instance is live, run our deployment script to initialize the lab:
